        <p id = "aboutParagraph">I am currently a student at Newcastle University 
            working towards a BSc in Computer Science and I am actively seeking 
            internships and work experience to help refine my skills and to gain new skills 
            that are vital to Software Engineering. During my four years of experience, I have 
            picked up languages such as C#, Python, Java and SQL and have even completed a project 
            using C# and SQL recently, which deepened my understanding of software development methodologies.

Yo, listen up. This website? **MINE.** Every single line of code, every pixel, every word—**all me.** You touch, steal, copy, or even think about using it without my permission? **Nah. Not happening.**  

## ❌ What You CAN’T Do  

- **Steal my code.** I see you, Ctrl+C bandits.  
- **Modify anything.** This isn’t a group project.  
- **Claim it’s yours.** Bro, seriously?  
- **Use my images, text, or design.** Get your own ideas.  
- **Reverse-engineer it.** What are you, a hacker?  

## ✅ What You CAN Do  

- **Look at it.** That’s it. Just admire from a distance.  

## 🚨 Consequences  

If you break these rules, I will **find out** and take legal action. Don’t test me. Lawyers exist, and I’m not afraid to use them.  

## 📝 Wanna Use Something?  

If for some reason you actually need to use something from my site, ask **nicely** first. Maybe, just maybe, I’ll say yes. No promises.
